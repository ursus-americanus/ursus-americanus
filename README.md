## Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
## I turn complex data ðŸ¤– and science ðŸ¦– into immersive and engaging narratives that everyone can enjoy ðŸ¤“




Right now, I do a lot of research on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) and whether people learn better through these technologies than traditional museum displays. This [article](https://www.aam-us.org/2020/06/15/towards-frictionless-augmented-reality/) summarizes my thoughts on how we can make AR more accesible for museum patrons.
