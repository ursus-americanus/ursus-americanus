## Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
## I turn complex data ðŸ¤– and science ðŸ¦– into immersive and engaging narratives that everyone can enjoy ðŸ¤“




Right now, I do a lot of research on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) and whether people learn better through these technologies than they do through traditional museum displays. This [article](https://www.aam-us.org/2020/06/15/towards-frictionless-augmented-reality/) summarizes my thoughts on how we can make AR more accesible for museum patrons.

# Research
Find my research publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hx6r5z0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). The code for any paper where I am the lead author is publicly archived with that paper's Supplemental Information under a DOI like this [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1286876](doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1286876).






### Are you looking for a virtual Ice Age friend?

Try out these Snapcodes of AR fossil animals I helped build. Stay tuned for a forthcoming paper describing how to create scientifically accurate paleoart models in AR.

### Are you looking for phylogenetic analysis software that can incorporate continuous probabilities of species occurence?
![mallorn](./Docs/mallorn_logo_small.png)

You should try out [`mallorn`](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/mallorn), my R package for calculating phylogenetic diversity metrics I developed like expected evolutionary distinctiveness (expected ED):

![expected ed](./Docs/Expected_ED.png)

While it was designed for biological research, [`mallorn`](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/mallorn) should technically work on any kind of hierarchical clustering dendrogram to probabilistically assign edge lengths to tips ...as long as the cophenetic distance between tips has real world meaning.

### Need to incorporate categorical or ordinal data into quantitative distance matrices for clustering or ordination? 

Read my suggestions and warnings in this [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.02.466687v1) first. (It also has a handy table of all the different ways you can calculate Gower's distance on ordinal data in R)

### Are you looking for the largest database of phylogenies, ranges, and functional traits for mammals?
![PHYLACINE](./Docs/PHYLACINE_logo_small.png)

You should check out the latest stable version of [PHYLACINE](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/PHYLACINE_1.2/): The Phylogenetic Atlas of Mammal Macroecology.

### Are you looking for functional traits for all large-bodied, terrestrial, avian and mammalian herbivores that lived during the last 130,000 years?
![HerbiTraits](./Docs/HerbiTraits_Logo.png)

You should check out the latest stable version of [HerbiTraits](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/HerbiTraits), a database led by my former PhD students.
